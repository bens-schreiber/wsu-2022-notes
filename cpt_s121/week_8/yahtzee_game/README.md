# Yahtzee by benjamin schreiber
The game rules I went off of is in https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/yahtzee.**pdf**

The game was designed to have as many players as wanted (2 minumum). Change the definiton in game.h to change the player count.

To rig the dice to check the scorecard, goto dice.c yahtzeeDiceRoll and uncomment.
