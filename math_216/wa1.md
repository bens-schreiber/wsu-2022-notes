# 1.1

4a) Given any real number $r$, there is a real number $s$ such that $s$ is greater than $r$

4b) For any real number $r$, there is a real number $s$ such that $s is greater than $r$

9a) All quadratic equations have at most two real solutions

9b) Every quadratic equation has at most two real solutions

9c) If an equation is quadratic, then it has at most two real solutions

9d) If $E$ is a quadratic equation, then $E$ has at most two real solutions

9e) For every quadratic equation $E$, $E$ has at most two real solutions

# 1.2

4a) Yes, 2 is in the set $\{2\}$

4b) There is one element in the set $\{2,2,2,2\}$

4c) There are two elements in the set $\{0, \{0\}\}$

4d) $\{0\}$ is an element of $\{\{0\}, \{1\}\}$

4e) 0 Is not an element of $\{\{0\}, \{1\}\}$

7b) $\{0,2\}$

16\) $xxxxy, xxxyx, xxyxx, xyxxx, yxxxx$

# 1.3

12\) $C(x) = yx \ \ \ C(yyxyx) = yyyxyx$

20\) For each $x\in \bold{R}, H(x)$ is equivalent to $K(x)$ by definition of equality of functions, $H = K$

# 1.4

6\) You can represent them the same because if you moved $v_4$ above $v_1$ and the connecting $v_3$ above $v_2$ you would get the exact same graph

7\) The bottom most point would be $v_6$ with $v_7$ and $v_5$ being the two upper most points
