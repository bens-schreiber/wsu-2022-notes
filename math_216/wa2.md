# 2.2

14a) When $p$ and $q$ are false, all of the statements are false, and are otherwise true.

14b) n is prime and n is not odd if n is 2, n is prime and not 2 if n is odd

20e) x is nonnegative and x is not positive and not 0

22e) If x is not positive and not 0 then x is negative

23e) Converse: If x is positive or x is 0, x is nonnegative. Inverse: If x is positive then x is not positive and not 0
