# Arguments
An argument is a set of setneces that is arranged to have the foloowing properties:
- Some subset of the sentences are called its premises 
- At least one member of the set of sentences is designated as the conclusion
- The set of premises is interpreted as supporting the conclusion by the architect of the argument
## EX:
> if it's raining, then the streets are wet (premise)

> its raining. (premise)

Therefore, the streets are wet


# Evaluating Arguents
When evaluating arguments, we must ask two questions:
1. Does the conclusion follow from the premises?
2. Are the premises true?
   
Question 1 is a matter of logic, question true relies on evidence


# Examples evalulated
> If it's raining then the streets are wet

True

> Its raining

False

> Therefore the streets are wet

False

1. Does the conclusion follow the premises? Yes
2. Are the premises true? No
   

# Follows from
What does it mean for a conclusion to follow from the premises?
- A set of claims, X, **deductively entails** a claim Y iff the truth of X guaruntees the truth of Y.
## EX:
> "I think; therefore I am"


# Validty and Soundness
- An argument is valid iff when the premises are true, the conclusion **must** also be true
  
OR

- An argument is valid iff it is impossible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false

Validity looks for if an argument makes sense. Soundness looks towards the real world to see if it actually works. Invalidity provokes the argument to not be sound.
