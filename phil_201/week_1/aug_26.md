# Counter Examples
A counterexample is a situation in which the premises could be true and the conclusion could be false

- If it is possible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false. then it is not impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false
-  i.e If there is one situation where that can happen, the argument is invalid

# Argument Forms
Some argument forms are always valid.
## EX:
> If P, then Q
> 
> P
> 
> Therefore, Q

Some arguments are always invalid
## EX: 
> If P, then Q
> 
> Q
> 
> Therefore, P

# Formal Logic
