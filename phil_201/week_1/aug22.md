# Sentences and Propositions
- A basic unit of logic is a sentence
- An expression is a string of symbols
- A sentence **in logic** is an expression that expresses a proposition.
- A proposition is a statement that is true or false, although we don't have to know what.
  
EX:
> The earth is 1,000 years old. 

> 2+5=9

# Truth
- A sentence is true if and only if the world is as the sentence says so.

- A belief is an attitude that one takes toward a proposition â€“ 
believe, deny, or suspend judgment.

- Opinions are the propositional attitude that you take toward a proposition

# Sentences in Logic
- A question is not a sentence in logic
- An imperative (command) is not a sentence in logic
A sentence in logic is either true or false. If a true or false response doesn't fit a response to the sentence, it isn't a sentence in logic.
