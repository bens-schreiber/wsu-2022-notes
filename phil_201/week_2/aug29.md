# Rule zero
A sentence symbol by itself is always a well formed formula (WWF)
## EX:
- P
- Q
- T
- Etc

# Rule 1. Negations
- if X is a WFF, then ~X is a WFF.
- if ~X is a WFF, then X is a WFF
- ~X is the negation of X
- ~~X is the negation of ~X
- ~X is the denial of X and X is the denial of ~X
- Negations add one tidle. Denials add or remove exactly one tidle.

# Rule 2. If X and Y are WFFs, then (X & Y) is a WFF.
## EX:
- ~P is a WFF
- Q is a WFF
- Thus, (~P & Q) is a WFF

# Rule 3. Disjunctions
If X and Y are WFF, then X v Y is a WFF

# Rule 4. Conditionals
If X and Y are WFF, then X -> Y is a WFF.

# Rule 5. Biconditionals
If X and Y are WFF, then X <-> Y is a WFF

# Rule 6.
Nothing else is a WFF.
